These are my own implementations of exercises from the book Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.

An excellent reference if you get stuck is [Eli Bendersky's blog][eli]. He has implemented every exercise in the book.

#Getting things done
This code works fine under MIT scheme (under Debian, 'mit-scheme'). For running scheme in Emacs, check out the [Scheme Wiki][swik].

To run within Emacs, use `M-x run-scheme`. That defaults to 'mzscheme' (racket), which doesn't support some of the functions we use (runtime, for one). Specify `scheme` or else configure your `~/.emacs` file.
